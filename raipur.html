              <blockquote>“Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today” — Malcolm X</blockquote>
              <p>As India treads on the path of being a future superpower, its youth will be its biggest strength. Amity, under the visionary leadership and guidance of its Founder President Dr Ashok K. Chauhan and Chairperson Dr (Mrs) Amita Chauhan, strives to nurture creative, compassionate and happy children who can build an intellectual and progressive India of the future.
                  
                  With the ethos of modernity blended with tradition, Amity is a holistic learning ecosystem which encourages young minds to think independently, act collaboratively and behave sensitively. Amity International School, Raipur, exemplifies one such ecosystem which is equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure. It seamlessly weaves modern and innovative teaching methodologies with a strong value system rooted in “Abhivaadan Shilayasa.”  We believe that personal development is the key difference between merely gaining knowledge and being truly educated.
                  
                  Our holistic approach focuses not only on academics but also on life skills that will help learners flourish as responsible global citizens. We value parents and guardians as our partners in progress in cultivating an ambience where children can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. Our mission is to provide a safe, caring, and joyful environment that nurtures happy children who will be instrumental in creating a happy family, a happy society, and a happy country.
